#  Holberton School - 0x1C. C - Binary trees
Description

The focus of this project is to learn:
* what a binary tree is.
* what the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree is.
* what the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists is.
* what the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree are.
* what the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree are.
* what a complete, a full, a perfect abd a balanced binary tree are.

## Environment
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* gcc standard C90
